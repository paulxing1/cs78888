    Note:
Part B of this assignment can be done in a group of two students or individually. Both students need to submit the assignment for both parts and provide both names, email, and student IDs at the top of the assignment. Submit your complete project, including your Python Notebook with markdown explanations, and a comprehensive PDF document. The PDF should contain clear screenshots of input/output commands with results, images of your deployed Azure portal resources, detailed step-by-step explanations for each process, and final output screenshots. Additionally, include a section in the PDF answering the provided questions (to be specified separately). Contact your TA for any questions related to this assignment or post clarification questions to the Piazza platform. PART A:

    [Marks:   5]   Explain   below   the   5   components   shown   in   orange   boxes.   Explain   which   Azure   components you will use where in this big data architecture and why.
    [Marks:   5] Explain how   Stream Analytics works in   Azure.   Mention   at   least   two   common   use   cases or applications for this   service.
    [Marks:   10]   Deploy   all   the   resources   in   Azure   Portal.   Implement   a   Stream   Analytics job   by   using   the   Azure   portal. See   this   for   reference   -https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/stream-   analytics/stream-analytics-quick-create-portal
For query use below: SELECT * INTO BlobOutput FROM IoTHubInput HAVING Temperature > 25 See the below screenshot and show the top 30 results for your output.

Part B: Data Input: Claim a dataset from Piazza - link. If the dataset is too large, you can take a subset of the data as well. No two groups can have the same dataset. Your selected dataset should meet the following criteria:

  It must contain   a minimum   of 1,000   instances   (rows   or   data points).
  It   should include   at   least   six   features   (columns   or   attributes).
Using this dataset, you are required to address a substantial and meaningful problem. Your analysis should demonstrate:

  A clear understanding of   the   dataset's   context   and potential   applications.
  The ability to   formulate relevant   questions   or hypotheses based   on   the   data.
  Appropriate   use   of   data   analysis   techniques   to   extract   insights.
  The capacity to draw meaningful conclusions that could inform. decision-making or代 写Assignment 5 Assignment on Azure Cloud PlatformPython

    Fraud Detection   System
    Customer Churn Rate Prediction
    Segmentation using Clustering
    Recommendations with your   Dataset
    Sales Forecasting
    Stock Price Predictions
  Human Activity Recognition with   Smartphones
    Wine Quality Predictions
    Breast Cancer Prediction
Sorting of Specific Tweets on Twitter etc. Implement this part in Azure Machine learning using Azure Notebook
    [Marks:    15]    Clearly define the problem you intend to address   using this dataset.      Present      a   comprehensive problem statement that includes:
a. A detailed description of the meaningful issue you're tackling b. An outline of all necessary steps, including: i. Data preprocessing ii. Data cleaning iii. Modeling approachYour problem statement should be thorough, spanning approximately half to one full page. If you determine that data cleaning is unnecessary, please provide a justification for why this dataset doesn't require cleaning. In such a case, allocate more attention to other crucial aspects such as EDA and the modeling process. Ensure your problem statement is well-structured, coherent, and provides a clear roadmap for your data analysis project. 2. [Marks: 10] Explore your dataset and provide at least 5 meaningful charts/graphs with an explanation. 3. [Marks: 10] Do data cleaning/pre-processing as required and explain what you have done for your dataset and why? 4. [Marks: 15] Implement 2 machine learning models and explain which algorithms you have selected and why. Compare them and show success metrics (Accuracy/RMSE/Confusion Matrix) as per your problem. Explain results. 5. [Marks: 15] Deploy a run-time pipeline for your dataset using Azure Designer Studio. Or Do hyperparameter tuning for your algorithms. Explain your results. Or Use Automated ML for your data set. Explain the best model results. 6. [Marks: 15] Summarize your project's key findings and overall conclusions in a brief paragraph. Ensure your summary is firmly grounded in the data and analysis you've presented throughout your project. Offer meaningful insights that not only encapsulate your work but also lay a foundation for potential future research in this area. Your conclusions should be well-reasoned and directly supported by your results.
